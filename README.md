# README
ActiveMeet is a Ruby on Rails web application I built during the Advanced Ruby course at Code the Dream. The app helps people create and join sports events. Users can sign up with secure authentication, choose a favorite sport, and manage their own events. Admins have extended permissions to manage all users, sports, and events, while regular users can only edit or delete the events they host.

The project allowed me to practice Rails models, associations, validations, authentication with bcrypt, role-based authorization, and responsive front-end design
